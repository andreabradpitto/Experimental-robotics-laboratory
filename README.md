# Andrea Pitto's Experimental robotics laboratory exercises
This is the repository for all the exercises I have performed of the Robotics engineering class "Experimental robotics laboratory" 2020/2021, held in the University of Genoa

## Instructions

### Exercise 1
Involved packages: **first_package**, **pos_server**. To run the code please launch ROS, then type in a terminal
```
rosrun stage_ros stageros $(rospack find exercise1)/world/exercise.world
rosrun exercise1 exercise1 _xt:=2.0 _yt:=3.0
rosrun pos_server position_server
```
[This](https://github.com/CarmineD8/exp-lab-exercises/tree/master/exercise1#monday-2809-exercise) is the official text for the assignment

### Exercise 2 to Exercise n
Due to time constraints, I have dropped formal reporting of all the exercises proposed at lecture time, save for the very first one. This also seems to be what the professor chose to do, as [this](https://github.com/CarmineD8/exp-lab-exercises) was supposed to be the overall folder for the exercises, but it comprises just the number 1. That said, part of the material used for the exercises is still available among [the professor's repositories](https://github.com/CarmineD8?tab=repositories)

### Assignment 1
Please refer to the readme and the documentation inside [its folder](https://github.com/andreabradpitto/Experimental-robotics-laboratory/tree/main/assignment1)

### Assignment 2
Please refer to the readme and the documentation inside [its folder](https://github.com/andreabradpitto/Experimental-robotics-laboratory/tree/main/assignment2)

### Assignment 3
Please refer to the readme and the documentation inside [its folder](https://github.com/andreabradpitto/Experimental-robotics-laboratory/tree/main/assignment3)
